# Some background information

Before we start implementing our `Futures`, we'll go through some background

## Concurrency in general

If you find the concepts of concurrency and async programming confusing in

to the subject.

I have spent quite a bit of time digging into these subjects myself, and I'll
point you to some of thos sources
