We already got a brief introduction of `Pin` in the previous chapters, so we'll
start off without any further introduction.

Let's jump strait to some definitions and then create a set of rules to remember. Let's call them the 10 commandments of Pinning. Unfortunately, my stonemasonry
skills are rather poor, so we'll have to settle by writing them in markdown
(for now).

## Definitions

Pin consists of the `Pin` type and the `Unpin` marker. Pin's purpose in life is
to govern the rules that need to apply for types which implement `!Unpin`.

Pin is only relevant for pointers. A reference to an object is a pointer.

Yep, you're right, that's double negation right there. `!Unpin` means
"not-un-pin".

This naming scheme is Rust deliberately testing if you're too tired to safely implement a type with this marker. If you're starting to get confused by
`!Unpin` it's a good sign that it's time to lay down the work and start over
tomorrow with a fresh mind.

> _Think of taking a thumbtack out of a cork board so you can tweak how a flyer looks. For Unpin types, this unpinning is directly supported by the type; you can do this implicitly. You can even swap out the object with another before you put the pin back. For other types, you must be much more careful._

An object with the `Unpin` marker can move.

For the next paragraph we'll rename these markers to:

> `!Unpin` = `MustStay` and `Unpin` = `CanMove`

It just makes it much easier to talk about them.

## Rules to remember

1. If `T: CanMove` (which is the default), then `Pin<'a, T>` is entirely equivalent to `&'a mut T`. in other words: `CanMove` means it's OK for this type to be moved even when pinned, so `Pin` will have no effect on such a type.

2. Getting a `&mut T` to a pinned pointer requires unsafe if `T: MustStay`. In other words: requiring a pinned pointer to a type which is `MustStay` prevents the _user_ of that API from moving that value unless it choses to write `unsafe` code.

3. Pinning does nothing special with that memory like putting it into some "read only" memory or anything fancy. It only tells the compiler that some operations on this value should be forbidden.

4. Most standard library types implement `CanMove`. The same goes for most 
"normal" types you encounter in Rust. `Futures` and `Generators` are two
exceptions.

5. The main use case for `Pin` is to allow self referential types, the whole
justification for stabilizing them was to allow that. There are still corner
cases in the API which are being explored.

6. The implementation behind objects that are `MustStay` is most likely unsafe.
Moving such a type can cause the universe to crash. As of the time of writing
this book, creating an reading fields of a self referential struct still requires `unsafe`.

1. You can add a `MustStay` bound on a type by nightly with a feature flag, or by adding `std::marker::PhantomPinned` to your type.

2. When Pinning, you can either pin a value to memory either on the stack or 
on the heap.

9. Pinning a `MustStay` pointer to the stack requires `unsafe`

10. Pinning a `MustStay` pointer to the heap does not require `unsafe`. There is a shortcut for doing this using `Box::pin`.

Let's take a look at an example:

```rust,editable
use std::pin::Pin;

fn main() {
    let mut test1 = Test::new("test1");
    test1.init();
    let mut test2 = Test::new("test2");
    test2.init();

    println!("a: {}, b: {}", test1.a(), test1.b());
    std::mem::swap(&mut test1, &mut test2); // try commenting out this line
    println!("a: {}, b: {}", test2.a(), test2.b());

}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Test {
    a: String,
    b: *const String,
}

impl Test {
    fn new(txt: &str) -> Self {
        let a = String::from(txt);
        Test {
            a,
            b: std::ptr::null(),
        }
    }
    
    fn init(&mut self) {
        let self_ref: *const String = &self.a;
        self.b = self_ref;
    }
    
    fn a(&self) -> &str {
        &self.a
    } 
    
    fn b(&self) -> &String {
        unsafe {&*(self.b)}
    }
}
```

Let's walk through this example since we'll be using it the rest of this chapter.

We have a self-referential struct `Test`. `Test` needs an `init` method to be
created which is strange but we'll need that to keep this example as short as
possible.

`Test` provides two methods to get a reference to the value of the fields
`a` and `b`. Since `b` is a reference to `a` we store it as a pointer since
the borrowing rules of Rust doesn't allow us to define this lifetime.

In our main method we first instantiate two instances of `Test` and print out
the value of the fields on `test1`. We get:

```rust, ignore
a: test1, b: test1
```


Next we swap the data stored at the memory location which `test1` is pointing to
with the data stored at the memory location `test2` is pointing to and vice a versa.

We should expect that printing the fields of `test2` should display the same as
`test1` (since the object we printed before the swap has moved there now).

```rust, ignore
a: test1, b: test2
```
The pointer to `b` still points to the old location. That location is now
occupied with the string "test2". This can be a bit hard to visualize so I made
a figure that i hope can help.

**Fig 1: Before and after swap**

As you can see this results in unwanted behavior. It's easy to get this to 
segfault, show UB and fail in other spectacular ways as well.

If we change the example to using `Pin` instead:

```rust,editable
use std::pin::Pin;
use std::marker::PhantomPinned;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Test {
    a: String,
    b: *const String,
    _marker: PhantomPinned,
}


impl Test {
    fn new(txt: &str) -> Self {
        let a = String::from(txt);
        Test {
            a,
            b: std::ptr::null(),
            // This makes our type `!Unpin`
            _marker: PhantomPinned,
        }
    }
    fn init(&mut self) {
        let self_ptr: *const String = &self.a;
        self.b = self_ptr;
    }

    fn a<'a>(self: Pin<&'a Self>) -> &'a str {
        &self.get_ref().a
    }

    fn b<'a>(self: Pin<&'a Self>) -> &'a String {
        unsafe { &*(self.b) }
    }
}

pub fn main() {
    let mut test1 = Test::new("test1");
    test1.init();
    let mut test1_pin = unsafe { Pin::new_unchecked(&mut test1) }; 
    let mut test2 = Test::new("test2");
    test2.init();
    let mut test2_pin = unsafe { Pin::new_unchecked(&mut test2) };

    println!(
        "a: {}, b: {}",
        Test::a(test1_pin.as_ref()),
        Test::b(test1_pin.as_ref())
    );

    // Try to uncomment this and see what happens
    // std::mem::swap(test1_pin.as_mut(), test2_pin.as_mut());
    println!(
        "a: {}, b: {}",
        Test::a(test2_pin.as_ref()),
        Test::b(test2_pin.as_ref())
    );
}

```

Now, what we've done here is pinning a stack address. That will always be
`unsafe` if our type implements `!Unpin` (aka `MustStay`).

We use some tricks here, including requiring an `init`. If we want to fix that
and let users avoid `unsafe` we need to pin our data on the heap instead.

> Stack pinning will always depend on the current stack frame we're in, so we
can't create a self referential object in one stack frame and return it since
any pointers we take to "self" is invalidated.

The next example solves some of our friction at the cost of a heap allocation.

```rust, editbable
use std::pin::Pin;
use std::marker::PhantomPinned;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Test {
    a: String,
    b: *const String,
    _marker: PhantomPinned,
}

impl Test {
    fn new(txt: &str) -> Pin<Box<Self>> {
        let a = String::from(txt);
        let t = Test {
            a,
            b: std::ptr::null(),
            _marker: PhantomPinned,
        };
        let mut boxed = Box::pin(t);
        let self_ptr: *const String = &boxed.as_ref().a;
        unsafe { boxed.as_mut().get_unchecked_mut().b = self_ptr };

        boxed
    }

    fn a<'a>(self: Pin<&'a Self>) -> &'a str {
        &self.get_ref().a
    }

    fn b<'a>(self: Pin<&'a Self>) -> &'a String {
        unsafe { &*(self.b) }
    }
}

pub fn main() {
    let mut test1 = Test::new("test1");
    let mut test2 = Test::new("test2");

    println!("a: {}, b: {}",test1.as_ref().a(), test1.as_ref().b());

    // Try to uncomment this and see what happens
    // std::mem::swap(&mut test1, &mut test2);
    println!("a: {}, b: {}",test2.as_ref().a(), test2.as_ref().b());
}
```

The fact that boxing (heap allocating) a value that implements `!Unpin` is safe
makes sense. Once the data is allocated on the heap it will have a stable address.

There is no need for us as users of the API to take special care and ensure
that the self-referential pointer stays valid.

There are ways to safely give some guarantees on stack pinning as well, but right
now you need to use a crate like [pin_utils]:[pin_utils] to do that.

### Projection/structural pinning

In short, projection is using a field on your type. `mystruct.field1` is a
projection. Structural pinning is using `Pin` on struct fields. This has several
caveats and is not something you'll normally see so I refer to the documentation
for that.

### Pin and Drop

The `Pin` guarantee exists from the moment the value is pinned until it's dropped.
In the `Drop` implementation you take a mutable reference to `self`, which means
extra care must be taken when implementing `Drop` for pinned types.

## Putting it all together

This is exactly what we'll do when we implement our own `Futures` stay tuned, 
we're soon finished.
