# Futures Explained in 200 lines of Rust

This is the repositoru for the book: [Futures Explained in 200 Lines of Rust][rendered].

The book aims to explain `Futures` in Rust using an example driven approach, and
the goal is to get a better understanding of `Futures` by implementing a toy
`Reactor`, a very simple `Executor` and our own `Futures`.
