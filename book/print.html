<p>This book aims to explain <code>Futures</code> in Rust using an example driven approach.</p>
<p>The goal is to get a better understanding of <code>Futures</code> by implementing a toy
<code>Reactor</code>, a very simple <code>Executor</code> and our own <code>Futures</code>. </p>
<p>We'll start off a bit differently than most other explanations. Instead of 
deferring some of the details about what's special about futures in Rust we 
try to tackle that head on first. We'll be as brief as possible, but as thorough 
as needed. This way, most questions will be answered and explored up front. </p>
<p>We'll end up with futures that can run an any executor like <code>tokio</code> and <code>async_str</code>.</p>
<p>In the end I've made some reader exercises you can do if you want to fix some
of the most glaring omissions and shortcuts we took and create a slightly better
example yourself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This book is developed in the open, and contributions are welcome. You'll find
<a href="https://github.com/cfsamson/books-futures-explained">the repository for the book itself here</a>. The final example which
you can clone, fork or copy <a href="https://github.com/cfsamson/examples-futures">can be found here</a></p>

<p>There are many good resources and examples already. First
of all, this book will focus on <code>Futures</code> and <code>async/await</code> specifically and
not in the context of any specific runtime.</p>
<p>Secondly, I've always found small runnable examples very exiting to learn from. 
Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook">Mdbook</a> the examples can even be edited and explored further
by uncommenting certain lines or adding new ones yourself. I use that quite a
but throughout so keep an eye out when reading through editable code segments.</p>
<p>It's all code that you can download, play with and learn from.</p>
<p>We'll and end up with an understandable example including a <code>Future</code>
implementation, an <code>Executor</code> and a <code>Reactor</code> in less than 200 lines of code. 
We don't rely on any dependencies or real I/O which means it's very easy to 
explore further and try your own ideas.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#credits-and-thanks" id="credits-and-thanks">Credits and thanks</a></h2>
<p>I'll like to take the chance of thanking the people behind <code>mio</code>, <code>tokio</code>, 
<code>async_std</code>, <code>Futures</code>, <code>libc</code>, <code>crossbeam</code> and many other libraries which so
much is built upon.  Even the RFCs that much of the design is built upon is 
very well written and very helpful. So thanks!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Before we start implementing our <code>Futures</code> , we'll go through some background
information that will help demystify some of the concepts we encounter.</p>
<p>Actually, after going through these concepts, implementing futures will seem
pretty simple. I promise.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#async-in-rust" id="async-in-rust">Async in Rust</a></h2>
<p>Let's get some of the common roadblocks out of the way first.</p>
<p>Async in Rust is different from most other languages in the sense that Rust
has a very lightweight runtime.</p>
<p>Languages like C#, JavaScript, Java and GO, already includes a runtime 
for handling concurrency. So if you come from one of those languages this will 
seem a bit strange to you.</p>
<p>In Rust you will have to make an active choice about which runtime to use.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#what-rusts-standard-library-takes-care-of" id="what-rusts-standard-library-takes-care-of">What Rust's standard library takes care of</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>The definition of an interruptible task</li>
<li>An efficient technique to start, suspend, resume and store tasks which are
executed concurrently.</li>
<li>A defined way to wake up a suspended task</li>
</ol>
<p>That's really what Rusts standard library does. As you see there is no definition
of non-blocking I/O, how these tasks are created or how they're run.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#what-you-need-to-find-elsewhere" id="what-you-need-to-find-elsewhere">What you need to find elsewhere</a></h3>
<p>A runtime. Well, in Rust we normally divide the runtime into two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Reactor</li>
<li>The Executor</li>
</ul>
<p>Reactors create leaf <code>Futures</code>, and provides things like non-blocking sockets,
an event queue and so on.</p>
<p>Executors, accepts one or more asynchronous tasks called <code>Futures</code> and takes
care of actually running the code we write, suspend the tasks when they're
waiting for I/O and resume them.</p>
<p>In theory, we could choose one <code>Reactor</code> and one <code>Executor</code> that have nothing
to do with each other besides that one creates leaf <code>Futures</code> and the other one
runs them, but in reality today you'll most often get both in a <code>Runtime</code>.</p>
<p>There are mainly two such runtimes today <a href="https://github.com/async-rs/async-std">async_std</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio">tokio</a>.</p>
<p>Quite a bit of complexity attributed to <code>Futures</code> are actually complexity rooted
in runtimes. Creating an efficient runtime is hard. </p>
<p>Learning how to use one correctly can require quite a bit of effort as well, but you'll see that there are several similarities between these kind of runtimes so
learning one makes learning the next much easier.</p>
<p>The difference between Rust and other languages is that you have to make an
active choice when it comes to picking a runtime. Most often you'll just use
the one provided for you.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#futures-10-and-futures-30" id="futures-10-and-futures-30">Futures 1.0 and Futures 3.0</a></h2>
<p>I'll not spend too much time on this, but it feels wrong to not mention that
there have been several iterations on how async should work in Rust.</p>
<p><code>Futures 3.0</code> works with the relatively new <code>async/await</code> syntax in Rust and
it's what we'll learn.</p>
<p>Now, since this is rather recent, you can encounter creates that use <code>Futures 1.0</code>
still. This will get resolved in time, but unfortunately it's not always easy
to know in advance.</p>
<p>A good sign is that if you're required to use combinators like <code>and_then</code> then
you're using <code>Futures 1.0</code>.</p>
<p>While they're not directly compatible, there is a tool that let's you relatively
easily convert a <code>Future 1.0</code> to a <code>Future 3.0</code> and vice a versa. You can find
all you need in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/futures-rs"><code>futures-rs</code></a> crate and all 
<a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/futures-rs/blog/2019/04/18/compatibility-layer.html">information you need here</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#first-things-first" id="first-things-first">First things first</a></h2>
<p>If you find the concepts of concurrency and async programming confusing in
general, I know where you're coming from and I have written some resources to 
try to give a high level overview that will make it easier to learn Rusts 
<code>Futures</code> afterwards:</p>

<p>Learning these concepts by studying futures is making it much harder than
it needs to be, so go on and read these chapters if you feel a bit unsure. </p>
<p>I'll be right here when you're back.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#trait-objects-and-dynamic-dispatch" id="trait-objects-and-dynamic-dispatch">Trait objects and dynamic dispatch</a></h2>
<p>One of the most confusing things we encounter when implementing our own <code>Futures</code> 
is how we implement a <code>Waker</code> . Creating a <code>Waker</code> involves creating a <code>vtable</code> 
which allows us to use dynamic dispatch to call methods on a <em>type erased</em> trait 
object we construct our selves.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Let's explain this a bit more in detail.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#fat-pointers-in-rust" id="fat-pointers-in-rust">Fat pointers in Rust</a></h2>
<p>Let's take a look at the size of some different pointer types in Rust. If we
run the following code. <em>(You'll have to press &quot;play&quot; to see the output)</em>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># use std::mem::size_of;
trait SomeTrait { }

fn main() {
    println!(&quot;======== The size of different pointers in Rust: ========&quot;);
    println!(&quot;&amp;dyn Trait:-----{}&quot;, size_of::&lt;&amp;dyn SomeTrait&gt;());
    println!(&quot;&amp;[&amp;dyn Trait]:--{}&quot;, size_of::&lt;&amp;[&amp;dyn SomeTrait]&gt;());
    println!(&quot;Box&lt;Trait&gt;:-----{}&quot;, size_of::&lt;Box&lt;SomeTrait&gt;&gt;());
    println!(&quot;&amp;i32:-----------{}&quot;, size_of::&lt;&amp;i32&gt;());
    println!(&quot;&amp;[i32]:---------{}&quot;, size_of::&lt;&amp;[i32]&gt;());
    println!(&quot;Box&lt;i32&gt;:-------{}&quot;, size_of::&lt;Box&lt;i32&gt;&gt;());
    println!(&quot;&amp;Box&lt;i32&gt;:------{}&quot;, size_of::&lt;&amp;Box&lt;i32&gt;&gt;());
    println!(&quot;[&amp;dyn Trait;4]:-{}&quot;, size_of::&lt;[&amp;dyn SomeTrait; 4]&gt;());
    println!(&quot;[i32;4]:--------{}&quot;, size_of::&lt;[i32; 4]&gt;());
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>As you see from the output after running this, the sizes of the references varies.
Many are 8 bytes (which is a pointer size on 64 bit systems), but some are 16
bytes.</p>
<p>The 16 byte sized pointers are called &quot;fat pointers&quot; since they carry extra
information.</p>
<p><strong>Example <code>&amp;[i32]</code> :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The first 8 bytes is the actual pointer to the first element in the array (or part of an array the slice refers to)</li>
<li>The second 8 bytes is the length of the slice.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example <code>&amp;dyn SomeTrait</code>:</strong></p>
<p>This is the type of fat pointer we'll concern ourselves about going forward.
<code>&amp;dyn SomeTrait</code> is a reference to a trait, or what Rust calls a <em>trait object</em>.</p>
<p>The layout for a pointer to a <em>trait object</em> looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first 8 bytes points to the <code>data</code> for the trait object</li>
<li>The second 8 bytes points to the <code>vtable</code> for the trait object</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for this is to allow us to refer to an object we know nothing about
except that it implements the methods defined by our trait. To accomplish this we use <em>dynamic dispatch</em>.</p>
<p>Let's explain this in code instead of words by implementing our own trait
object from these parts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an example of <em>editable</em> code. You can change everything in the example
and try to run it. If you want to go back, press the undo symbol. Keep an eye
out for these as we go forward. Many examples will be editable.</p>

<p>The reason we go through this will be clear later on when we implement our own
<code>Waker</code> we'll actually set up a <code>vtable</code> like we do here to and knowing what
it is will make this much less mysterious.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#generators" id="generators">Generators</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Relevant for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding how the async/await syntax works since it's how <code>await</code> is implemented</li>
<li>Knowing why we need <code>Pin</code></li>
<li>Understanding why Rusts async model is very efficient</li>
</ul>
<p>The motivation for <code>Generators</code> can be found in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2033-experimental-coroutines.md">RFC#2033</a>. It's very
well written and I can recommend reading through it (it talks as much about
async/await as it does about generators).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second difficult part is understanding Generators and the <code>Pin</code> type. Since
they're related we'll start off by exploring generators first. By doing that
we'll soon get to see why we need to be able to &quot;pin&quot; some data to a fixed
location in memory and get an introduction to <code>Pin</code> as well.</p>
<p>Basically, there were three main options discussed when designing how Rust would
handle concurrency:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stackful coroutines, better known as green threads.</li>
<li>Using combinators.</li>
<li>Stackless coroutines, better known as generators.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a class="header" href="#stackful-coroutinesgreen-threads" id="stackful-coroutinesgreen-threads">Stackful coroutines/green threads</a></h3>
<p>I've written about green threads before. Go check out 
<a href="https://cfsamson.gitbook.io/green-threads-explained-in-200-lines-of-rust/">Green Threads Explained in 200 lines of Rust</a> if you're interested.</p>
<p>Green threads uses the same mechanism as an OS does by creating a thread for
each task, setting up a stack, save the CPU's state and jump from one
task(thread) to another by doing a &quot;context switch&quot;.</p>
<p>We yield control to the scheduler (which is a central part of the runtime in
such a system) which then continues running a different task.</p>
<p>Rust had green threads once, but they were removed before it hit 1.0. The state
of execution is stored in each stack so in such a solution there would be no need
for <code>async</code>, <code>await</code>, <code>Futures</code> or <code>Pin</code>. All this would be implementation details for the library.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#combinators" id="combinators">Combinators</a></h3>
<p><code>Futures 1.0</code> used combinators. If you've worked with <code>Promises</code> in JavaScript,
you already know combinators. In Rust they look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplaypen ignore">let future = Connection::connect(conn_str).and_then(|conn| {
    conn.query(&quot;somerequest&quot;).map(|row|{
        SomeStruct::from(row)
    }).collect::&lt;Vec&lt;SomeStruct&gt;&gt;()
});

let rows: Result&lt;Vec&lt;SomeStruct&gt;, SomeLibraryError&gt; = block_on(future).unwrap();

</code></pre>
<p>While an effective solution there are mainly three downsides I'll focus on:</p>
<ol>
<li>The error messages produced could be extremely long and arcane</li>
<li>Not optimal memory usage</li>
<li>Did not allow to borrow across combinator steps.</li>
</ol>
<p>Point #3, is actually a major drawback with <code>Futures 1.0</code>.</p>
<p>Not allowing borrows across suspension points ends up being very
un-ergonomic and to accomplish some tasks it requires extra allocations or
copying which is inefficient.</p>
<p>The reason for the higher than optimal memory usage is that this is basically
a callback-based approach, where each closure stores all the data it needs
for computation. This means that as we chain these, the memory required to store
the needed state increases with each added step.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#stackless-coroutinesgenerators" id="stackless-coroutinesgenerators">Stackless coroutines/generators</a></h3>
<p>This is the model used in Rust today. It has a few notable advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's easy to convert normal Rust code to a stackless coroutine using using
async/await as keywords (it can even be done using a macro).</li>
<li>No need for context switching and saving/restoring CPU state</li>
<li>No need to handle dynamic stack allocation</li>
<li>Very memory efficient</li>
<li>Allowed for borrows across suspension points</li>
</ol>
<p>The last point is in contrast to <code>Futures 1.0</code>. With async/await we can do this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">async fn myfn() {
    let text = String::from(&quot;Hello world&quot;);
    let borrowed = &amp;text[0..5];
    somefuture.await;
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, borrowed);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Generators in Rust are implemented as state machines. The memory footprint of a
chain of computations is only defined by the largest footprint of any single
step require. That means that adding steps to a chain of computations might not
require any increased memory at all.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#how-generators-work" id="how-generators-work">How generators work</a></h2>
<p>In Nightly Rust today you can use the <code>yield</code> keyword. Basically using this
keyword in a closure, converts it to a generator. A closure looking like this
(I'm going to use the terminology that's currently in Rust):</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplaypen ignore">let a = 4;
let b = move || {
        println!(&quot;Hello&quot;);
        yield a * 2;
        println!(&quot;world!&quot;);
    };

if let GeneratorState::Yielded(n) = gen.resume() {
        println!(&quot;Got value {}&quot;, n);
    }

if let GeneratorState::Complete(()) = gen.resume() {
        ()
};
</code></pre>
<p>Early on, before there was a consensus about the design of <code>Pin</code>, this
compiled to something looking similar to this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let mut gen = GeneratorA::start(4);

    if let GeneratorState::Yielded(n) = gen.resume() {

    }

    if let GeneratorState::Complete(()) = gen.resume() {
        ()
    };
}

// If you've ever wondered why the parameters are called Y and R the naming from
// the original rfc most likely holds the answer

    type Return = ();

        // lets us get ownership over current state
        match std::mem::replace(&amp;mut *self, GeneratorA::Exit) {
            GeneratorA::Enter(a1) =&gt; {

          /*|---code before yield---|*/

                GeneratorState::Yielded(a)
            }
            GeneratorA::Yield1(_) =&gt; {

<blockquote>
<p>The <code>yield</code> keyword was discussed first in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1823">RFC#1823</a> and in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1832">RFC#1832</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that you know that the <code>yield</code> keyword in reality rewrites your code to become a state machine,
you'll also know the basics of how <code>await</code> works. It's very similar.</p>
<p>Now, there are some limitations in our naive state machine above. What happens when you have a 
<code>borrow</code> across a <code>yield</code> point?</p>
<p>We could forbid that, but <strong>one of the major design goals for the async/await syntax has been
to allow this</strong>. These kinds of borrows were not possible using <code>Futures 1.0</code> so we can't let this
limitation just slip and call it a day yet.</p>
<p>Instead of discussing it in theory, let's look at some code. </p>

<p>We'll use the optimized version of the state machines which is used in Rust today. For a more

<p>If you try to compile this you'll get an error (just try it yourself by pressing play).</p>
<p>What is the lifetime of <code>&amp;String</code>. It's not the same as the lifetime of <code>Self</code>. It's not <code>static</code>.
Turns out that it's not possible for us in Rusts syntax to describe this lifetime, which means, that
to make this work, we'll have to let the compiler know that <em>we</em> control this correctly ourselves.</p>
<p>That means turning to unsafe.</p>
<p>Let's try to write an implementation that will compiler using <code>unsafe</code>. As you'll
see we end up in a <em>self referential struct</em>. A struct which holds references
into itself.</p>

<p>Now, as you see, the consumer of this API must either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Box the value and thereby allocating it on the heap</li>
<li>Use <code>unsafe</code> and pin the value to the stack. The user knows that if they move
the value afterwards it will violate the guarantee they promise to uphold when
they did their unsafe implementation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully, after this you'll have an idea of what happens when you use the

<p><code>Pin</code> was suggested in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2349-pin.md">RFC#2349</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We already got a brief introduction of <code>Pin</code> in the previous chapters, so we'll
start off without any further introduction.</p>
<p>Let's jump strait to some definitions and then create a set of rules to remember. Let's call them the 10 commandments of Pinning. Unfortunately, my stonemasonry
skills are rather poor, so we'll have to settle by writing them in markdown
(for now).</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#definitions" id="definitions">Definitions</a></h2>
<p>Pin consists of the <code>Pin</code> type and the <code>Unpin</code> marker. Pin's purpose in life is
to govern the rules that need to apply for types which implement <code>!Unpin</code>.</p>
<p>Pin is only relevant for pointers. A reference to an object is a pointer.</p>
<p>Yep, you're right, that's double negation right there. <code>!Unpin</code> means
&quot;not-un-pin&quot;.</p>
<p>This naming scheme is Rust deliberately testing if you're too tired to safely implement a type with this marker. If you're starting to get confused by
<code>!Unpin</code> it's a good sign that it's time to lay down the work and start over
tomorrow with a fresh mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That was of course a joke. There are very valid reasons for the names
that were chosen. If you want you can read a bit of the discussion from the
<a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/naming-pin-anchor-move/6864/12">internals thread</a>. The best takeaway from there in my eyes
is this quote from <code>tmandry</code>:</p>
<p><em>Think of taking a thumbtack out of a cork board so you can tweak how a flyer looks. For Unpin types, this unpinning is directly supported by the type; you can do this implicitly. You can even swap out the object with another before you put the pin back. For other types, you must be much more careful.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the next paragraph we'll rename these markers to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>!Unpin</code> = <code>MustStay</code> and <code>Unpin</code> = <code>CanMove</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It just makes it much easier to talk about them.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#rules-to-remember" id="rules-to-remember">Rules to remember</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If <code>T: CanMove</code> (which is the default), then <code>Pin&lt;'a, T&gt;</code> is entirely equivalent to <code>&amp;'a mut T</code>. in other words: <code>CanMove</code> means it's OK for this type to be moved even when pinned, so <code>Pin</code> will have no effect on such a type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getting a <code>&amp;mut T</code> to a pinned pointer requires unsafe if <code>T: MustStay</code>. In other words: requiring a pinned pointer to a type which is <code>MustStay</code> prevents the <em>user</em> of that API from moving that value unless it choses to write <code>unsafe</code> code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pinning does nothing special with memory allocation like putting it into some &quot;read only&quot; memory or anything fancy. It only tells the compiler that some operations on this value should be forbidden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most standard library types implement <code>CanMove</code>. The same goes for most
&quot;normal&quot; types you encounter in Rust. <code>Futures</code> and <code>Generators</code> are two
exceptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The main use case for <code>Pin</code> is to allow self referential types, the whole
justification for stabilizing them was to allow that. There are still corner
cases in the API which are being explored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The implementation behind objects that are <code>MustStay</code> is most likely unsafe.
Moving such a type can cause the universe to crash. As of the time of writing
this book, creating and reading fields of a self referential struct still requires <code>unsafe</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can add a <code>MustStay</code> bound on a type on nightly with a feature flag, or
by adding <code>std::marker::PhantomPinned</code> to your type on stable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can either pin a value to memory on the stack or on the heap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pinning a <code>MustStay</code> pointer to the stack requires <code>unsafe</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pinning a <code>MustStay</code> pointer to the heap does not require <code>unsafe</code>. There is a shortcut for doing this using <code>Box::pin</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Unsafe code does not mean it's literally &quot;unsafe&quot;, it only relieves the 
guarantees you normally get from the compiler. An <code>unsafe</code> implementation can 
be perfectly safe to do, but you have no safety net.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's take a look at an example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust editable">use std::pin::Pin;

fn main() {
    let mut test1 = Test::new(&quot;test1&quot;);
    test1.init();
    let mut test2 = Test::new(&quot;test2&quot;);
    test2.init();

    println!(&quot;a: {}, b: {}&quot;, test1.a(), test1.b());
    std::mem::swap(&amp;mut test1, &amp;mut test2); // try commenting out this line
    println!(&quot;a: {}, b: {}&quot;, test2.a(), test2.b());

}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Test {
    a: String,
    b: *const String,
}

impl Test {
    fn new(txt: &amp;str) -&gt; Self {
        let a = String::from(txt);
        Test {
            a,
            b: std::ptr::null(),
        }
    }
    
    fn init(&amp;mut self) {
        let self_ref: *const String = &amp;self.a;
        self.b = self_ref;
    }
    
    fn a(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;str {
        &amp;self.a
    } 
    
    fn b(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;String {
        unsafe {&amp;*(self.b)}
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Let's walk through this example since we'll be using it the rest of this chapter.</p>
<p>We have a self-referential struct <code>Test</code>. <code>Test</code> needs an <code>init</code> method to be
created which is strange but we'll need that to keep this example as short as
possible.</p>
<p><code>Test</code> provides two methods to get a reference to the value of the fields
<code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. Since <code>b</code> is a reference to <code>a</code> we store it as a pointer since
the borrowing rules of Rust doesn't allow us to define this lifetime.</p>
<p>In our main method we first instantiate two instances of <code>Test</code> and print out
the value of the fields on <code>test1</code>. We get:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">a: test1, b: test1
</code></pre>
<p>Next we swap the data stored at the memory location which <code>test1</code> is pointing to
with the data stored at the memory location <code>test2</code> is pointing to and vice a versa.</p>
<p>We should expect that printing the fields of <code>test2</code> should display the same as
<code>test1</code> (since the object we printed before the swap has moved there now).</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">a: test1, b: test2
</code></pre>
<p>The pointer to <code>b</code> still points to the old location. That location is now
occupied with the string &quot;test2&quot;. This can be a bit hard to visualize so I made
a figure that i hope can help.</p>
<p><strong>Fig 1: Before and after swap</strong>
<img src="./assets/swap_problem.jpg" alt="swap_problem" /></p>
<p>As you can see this results in unwanted behavior. It's easy to get this to 
segfault, show UB and fail in other spectacular ways as well.</p>
<p>If we change the example to using <code>Pin</code> instead:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust editable">use std::pin::Pin;
use std::marker::PhantomPinned;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Test {
    a: String,
    b: *const String,
    _marker: PhantomPinned,
}


impl Test {
    fn new(txt: &amp;str) -&gt; Self {
        let a = String::from(txt);
        Test {
            a,
            b: std::ptr::null(),
            // This makes our type `!Unpin`
            _marker: PhantomPinned,
        }
    }
    fn init(&amp;mut self) {
        let self_ptr: *const String = &amp;self.a;
        self.b = self_ptr;
    }

    fn a&lt;'a&gt;(self: Pin&lt;&amp;'a Self&gt;) -&gt; &amp;'a str {
        &amp;self.get_ref().a
    }

    fn b&lt;'a&gt;(self: Pin&lt;&amp;'a Self&gt;) -&gt; &amp;'a String {
        unsafe { &amp;*(self.b) }
    }
}

pub fn main() {
    let mut test1 = Test::new(&quot;test1&quot;);
    test1.init();
    let mut test1_pin = unsafe { Pin::new_unchecked(&amp;mut test1) }; 
    let mut test2 = Test::new(&quot;test2&quot;);
    test2.init();
    let mut test2_pin = unsafe { Pin::new_unchecked(&amp;mut test2) };

    println!(
        &quot;a: {}, b: {}&quot;,
        Test::a(test1_pin.as_ref()),
        Test::b(test1_pin.as_ref())
    );

    // Try to uncomment this and see what happens
    // std::mem::swap(test1_pin.as_mut(), test2_pin.as_mut());
    println!(
        &quot;a: {}, b: {}&quot;,
        Test::a(test2_pin.as_ref()),
        Test::b(test2_pin.as_ref())
    );
}

</code></pre></pre>
<p>Now, what we've done here is pinning a stack address. That will always be
<code>unsafe</code> if our type implements <code>!Unpin</code> (aka <code>MustStay</code>).</p>
<p>We use some tricks here, including requiring an <code>init</code>. If we want to fix that
and let users avoid <code>unsafe</code> we need to pin our data on the heap instead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stack pinning will always depend on the current stack frame we're in, so we
can't create a self referential object in one stack frame and return it since
any pointers we take to &quot;self&quot; is invalidated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next example solves some of our friction at the cost of a heap allocation.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust editbable">use std::pin::Pin;

        let self_ptr: *const String = &amp;boxed.as_ref().a;
        unsafe { boxed.as_mut().get_unchecked_mut().b = self_ptr };

        boxed
    }

    fn a&lt;'a&gt;(self: Pin&lt;&amp;'a Self&gt;) -&gt; &amp;'a str {

}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The fact that boxing (heap allocating) a value that implements <code>!Unpin</code> is safe
makes sense. Once the data is allocated on the heap it will have a stable address.</p>
<p>There is no need for us as users of the API to take special care and ensure
that the self-referential pointer stays valid.</p>
<p>There are ways to safely give some guarantees on stack pinning as well, but right
now you need to use a crate like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2349-pin.md">pin_utils</a>:<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2349-pin.md">pin_utils</a> to do that.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#projectionstructural-pinning" id="projectionstructural-pinning">Projection/structural pinning</a></h3>
<p>In short, projection is a programming language term. <code>mystruct.field1</code> is a
projection. Structural pinning is using <code>Pin</code> on fields. This has several
caveats and is not something you'll normally see so I refer to the documentation
for that.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#pin-and-drop" id="pin-and-drop">Pin and Drop</a></h3>
<p>The <code>Pin</code> guarantee exists from the moment the value is pinned until it's dropped.
In the <code>Drop</code> implementation you take a mutable reference to <code>self</code>, which means
extra care must be taken when implementing <code>Drop</code> for pinned types.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#putting-it-all-together" id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</a></h2>
<p>This is exactly what we'll do when we implement our own <code>Futures</code> stay tuned, 
we're soon finished.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#futures-in-rust" id="futures-in-rust">Futures in Rust</a></h1>
<p>We'll create our own <code>Futures</code> together with a fake reactor and a simple
executor which allows you to edit, run an play around with the code right here
in your browser.</p>
<p>I'll walk you through the example, but if you want to check it out closer, you
can always <a href="https://github.com/cfsamson/examples-futures">clone the repository</a> and play around with the code yourself.</p>
<p>There are several branches explained in the readme, but two are
relevant for this chapter. The <code>main</code> branch is the example we go through here,
and the <code>basic_example_commented</code> branch is this example with extensive
comments.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#implementing-our-own-futures" id="implementing-our-own-futures">Implementing our own Futures</a></h2>
<p>Let's start off by getting all our imports right away so you can follow along</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplaypen ignore">use std::{
    future::Future, pin::Pin, sync::{mpsc::{channel, Sender}, Arc, Mutex},
    task::{Context, Poll, RawWaker, RawWakerVTable, Waker},

};
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-executor" id="the-executor">The Executor</a></h2>
<p>The executors responsibility is to take one or more futures and run them to completion.</p>
<p>The first thing an <code>executor</code> does when it gets a <code>Future</code> is polling it.</p>
<p><strong>When polled one of three things can happen:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The future returns <code>Ready</code> and we schedule whatever chained operations to run</li>
<li>The future hasn't been polled before so we pass it a <code>Waker</code> and suspend it</li>
<li>The futures has been polled before but is not ready and returns <code>Pending</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Rust provides a way for the Reactor and Executor to communicate through the <code>Waker</code>. The reactor stores this <code>Waker</code> and calls <code>Waker::wake()</code> on it once
a <code>Future</code> has resolved and should be polled again.</p>
<p><strong>Our Executor will look like this:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplaypen ignore">// Our executor takes any object which implements the `Future` trait
fn block_on&lt;F: Future&gt;(mut future: F) -&gt; F::Output {
    // the first thing we do is to construct a `Waker` which we'll pass on to
    // the `reactor` so it can wake us up when an event is ready. 
    let mywaker = Arc::new(MyWaker{ thread: thread::current() }); 
    let waker = waker_into_waker(Arc::into_raw(mywaker));
    // The context struct is just a wrapper for a `Waker` object. Maybe in the
    // future this will do more, but right now it's just a wrapper.
    let mut cx = Context::from_waker(&amp;waker);

    // We poll in a loop, but it's not a busy loop. It will only run when
    // an event occurs, or a thread has a &quot;spurious wakeup&quot; (an unexpected wakeup
    // that can happen for no good reason).
    let val = loop {
        // So, since we run this on one thread and run one future to completion
        // we can pin the `Future` to the stack. This is unsafe, but saves an
        // allocation. We could `Box::pin` it too if we wanted. This is however
        // safe since we don't move the `Future` here.
        let pinned = unsafe { Pin::new_unchecked(&amp;mut future) };
        match Future::poll(pinned, &amp;mut cx) {
            // when the Future is ready we're finished
            Poll::Ready(val) =&gt; break val,
            // If we get a `pending` future we just go to sleep...
            Poll::Pending =&gt; thread::park(),
        };
    };
    val
}
</code></pre>
<p>Inn all the examples here I've chose to comment the code extensively. I find it
easier to follow that way than dividing if up into many paragraphs.</p>
<p>We'll see more about the <code>Waker</code> in the next paragraph, but just look at it like
a <em>trait object</em> similar to the one we constructed  in the first chapter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Context</code> is just a wrapper around the <code>Waker</code>. At the time of writing this
book it's nothing more. In the future it might be possible that the <code>Context</code>
object will do more than just wrapping a <code>Future</code> so having this extra 
abstraction gives some flexibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You'll notice how we use <code>Pin</code> here to pin the future when we poll it.</p>
<p>Now that you've read so much about <code>Generators</code> and <code>Pin</code> already this should
be rather easy to understand. <code>Future</code> is a state machine, every <code>await</code> point
is a <code>yield</code> point. We could borrow data across <code>await</code> points and we meet the
exact same challenges as we do when borrowing across <code>yield</code> points.</p>
<p>As we explained in the <a href="./3_generators_pin.html">chapter about generators</a>, we use
<code>Pin</code> and the guarantees that give us to allow <code>Futures</code> to have self
references.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-future-implementation" id="the-future-implementation">The <code>Future</code> implementation</a></h2>
<p>In Rust we call an interruptible task a <code>Future</code>. Futures has a well defined interface, which means they can be used across the entire ecosystem. We can chain
these <code>Futures</code> so that once a &quot;leaf future&quot; is ready we'll perform a set of
operations.</p>
<p>These chained operations can spawn new leaf futures themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Our Future implementation looks like this:</strong></p>

</code></pre>
<p>This is mostly pretty straight forward. The confusing part is the strange way
we need to construct the <code>Waker</code>, but since we've already created our own
<em>trait objects</em> from raw parts, this looks pretty familiar. Actually, it's
even a bit easier.</p>
<p>We use an <code>Arc</code> here to pass out a ref-counted borrow of our <code>MyWaker</code>. This
is pretty normal, and makes this easy and safe to work with. Cloning a <code>Waker</code>
is just increasing the refcount in this case.</p>
<p>Dropping a <code>Waker</code> is as easy as decreasing the refcount. Now, in special
cases we could choose to not use an <code>Arc</code>. So this low-level method is there
to allow such cases. </p>
<p>Indeed, if we only used <code>Arc</code> there is no reason for us to go through all the 
trouble of creating our own <code>vtable</code> and a <code>RawWaker</code>. We could just implement
a normal trait.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in the future this will probably be possible in the standard
library as well. For now, <a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/futures-api-docs/0.3.0-alpha.13/futures/task/trait.ArcWake.html">this trait lives in the nursery</a>, but my
guess is that this will be a part of the standard library after som maturing.</p>
<p>We choose to pass in a reference to the whole <code>Reactor</code> here. This isn't normal.
The reactor will often be a global resource which let's us register interests
without passing around a reference.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#why-using-thread-parkunpark-is-a-bad-idea-for-a-library" id="why-using-thread-parkunpark-is-a-bad-idea-for-a-library">Why using thread park/unpark is a bad idea for a library</a></h3>
<p>It could deadlock easily since anyone could get a handle to the <code>executor thread</code>
and call park/unpark on it.</p>
<p>If one of our <code>Futures</code> holds a handle to our thread, or any unrelated code
calls <code>unpark</code> on our thread, the following could happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>A future could call <code>unpark</code> on the executor thread from a different thread</li>
<li>Our <code>executor</code> thinks that data is ready and wakes up and polls the future</li>
<li>The future is not ready yet when polled, but at that exact same time the 
<code>Reactor</code> gets an event and calls <code>wake()</code> which also unparks our thread.</li>
<li>This could happen before we go to sleep again since these processes
run in parallel.</li>
<li>Our reactor has called <code>wake</code> but our thread is still sleeping since it was
awake already at that point.</li>
<li>We're deadlocked and our program stops working</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>There is also the case that our thread could have what's called a
<code>spurious wakeup</code> (<a href="https://cfsamson.github.io/book-exploring-async-basics/9_3_http_module.html#bonus-section">which can happen unexpectedly</a>), which
could cause the same deadlock if we're unlucky.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many better solutions, here are some:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/struct.Condvar.html">std::sync::CondVar</a></li>
<li>Use <a href="https://docs.rs/crossbeam/0.7.3/crossbeam/sync/struct.Parker.html">crossbeam::sync::Parker</a></li>

<h2><a class="header" href="#the-reactor" id="the-reactor">The Reactor</a></h2>
<p>This is the home stretch, and not strictly <code>Future</code> related, but we need one
to have an example to run.</p>
<p>Since concurrency mostly makes sense when interacting with the outside world (or
at least some peripheral), we need something to actually abstract over this
interaction in an asynchronous way. </p>
<p>This is the <code>Reactors</code> job. Most often you'll see reactors in Rust use a library called <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio">Mio</a>, which provides non 
blocking APIs and event notification for several platforms.</p>
<p>The reactor will typically give you something like a <code>TcpStream</code> (or any other resource) which you'll use to create an I/O request. What you get in return
is a <code>Future</code>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the <code>Reactor</code> is registered as a global resource (which
is pretty normal), our <code>Task</code> in would instead be a special <code>TcpStream</code> which
registers interest with the global <code>Reactor</code> and no reference is needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can call this kind of <code>Future</code> a &quot;leaf Future&quot;, since it's some operation 
we'll actually wait on and that we can chain operations on which are performed
once the leaf future is ready. </p>
<p><strong>Our Reactor will look like this:</strong></p>

<p>This is the first time we actually see the <code>async/await</code> syntax so let's
finish this book by explaining them briefly.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the <code>await</code> syntax looks pretty familiar. It has a lot in common
with <code>yield</code> and indeed, it works in much the same way.</p>
<p>The <code>async</code> keyword can be used on functions as in <code>async fn(...)</code> or on a
block as in <code>async { ... }</code>. Both will turn your function, or block, into a
<code>Future</code>.</p>
<p>These <code>Futures</code> are rather simple. Imagine our generator from a few chapters
back. Every <code>await</code> point is like a <code>yield</code> point.</p>
<p>Instead of <code>yielding</code> a value we pass in, it yields the <code>Future</code> we're awaiting.
In turn this <code>Future</code> is polled. </p>
<p>Now, as is the case in our code, our <code>mainfut</code> contains two non-leaf futures
which it awaits, and all that happens is that these state machines are polled
as well until some &quot;leaf future&quot; in the end is finally polled and either
returns <code>Ready</code> or <code>Pending</code>.</p>
<p>The way our example is right now, it's not much better than regular synchronous
code. For us to actually await multiple futures at the same time we somehow need
to <code>spawn</code> them so they're polled once, but does not cause our thread to sleep
and wait for them one after one.</p>
<p>Our example as it stands now returns this:</p>
<pre><code>Future got 1 at time: 1.00.
Future got 2 at time: 3.00.
</code></pre>
<p>If these <code>Futures</code> were executed asynchronously we would expect to see:</p>
<pre><code>Future got 1 at time: 1.00.
Future got 2 at time: 2.00.
</code></pre>
<p>To accomplish this we can create the simplest possible <code>spawn</code> function I could
come up with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore noplaypen">fn spawn&lt;F: Future&gt;(future: F) -&gt; Pin&lt;Box&lt;F&gt;&gt; {
    // We start off the same way as we did before
    let mywaker = Arc::new(MyWaker{ thread: thread::current() });
    let waker = waker_into_waker(Arc::into_raw(mywaker));
    let mut cx = Context::from_waker(&amp;waker);
    
    // But we need to Box this Future. We can't pin it to this stack frame
    // since we'll return before the `Future` is resolved so it must be pinned
    // to the heap.
    let mut boxed = Box::pin(future);
    // Now we poll and just discard the result. This way, we register a `Waker`
    // with our `Reactor` and kick of whatever operation we're expecting.
    let _ = Future::poll(boxed.as_mut(), &amp;mut cx);
    
    // We still need this `Future` since we'll await it later so we return it...
    boxed
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now if we change our code in <code>main</code> to look like this instead.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let start = Instant::now();
    let reactor = Reactor::new();
    let reactor = Arc::new(Mutex::new(reactor));

    let future2 = Task::new(reactor.clone(), 2, 2);

    let fut1 = async {
        let val = future1.await;
        let dur = (Instant::now() - start).as_secs_f32();
        println!(&quot;Future got {} at time: {:.2}.&quot;, val, dur);
    };

    let fut2 = async {
        let val = future2.await;
        let dur = (Instant::now() - start).as_secs_f32();
        println!(&quot;Future got {} at time: {:.2}.&quot;, val, dur);
    };

    // You'll notice everything stays the same until this point
    let mainfut = async {
        // Here we &quot;kick off&quot; our first `Future`
        let handle1 = spawn(fut1);
        // And the second one
        let handle2 = spawn(fut2);

        // Now, they're already started, and when they get polled in our
        // executor now they will just return `Pending`, or if we somehow used
        // so much time that they're already resolved, they will return `Ready`.
        handle1.await;
        handle2.await;
    };

    block_on(mainfut);
    reactor.lock().map(|mut r| r.close()).unwrap();
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>If you add this code to our example and run it, you'll see:</p>
<pre><code>Future got 1 at time: 1.00.
Future got 2 at time: 2.00.
</code></pre>
<p>Exactly as we expected.</p>
<p>Now this <code>spawn</code> method is not very sophisticated but it explains the concept.
I've <a href="./conclusion.html#building-a-better-exectuor">challenged you to create a better version</a> and pointed you at a better resource
in the next chapter under <a href="./conclusion.html#reader-exercises">reader exercises</a>.</p>
<p>That's actually it for now. There are probably much more to learn, but I think it
will be easier once the fundamental concepts are there and that further
exploration will get a lot easier. </p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#conclusion-and-exercises" id="conclusion-and-exercises">Conclusion and exercises</a></h1>
<p>Congratulations. Good job! If you got this far you must have stayed with me
all the way. I hope you enjoyed the ride!</p>
<p>I'll leave you with some predictions and a set of exercises I'm suggesting for
those interested.</p>
<p>Futures will be more ergonomic to use with time. For example, instead of having
to create a <code>RawWaker</code> and so on, the <code>Waker</code> will also be possible to implement
as a normal <code>Trait</code>. It's probably going to be pretty similar to
<a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/futures-api-docs/0.3.0-alpha.13/futures/task/trait.ArcWake.html">ArcWake</a>.</p>
<p>There will probably be several more improvements like this, but since relatively
few people will actually need implement leaf Futures compared to those that use
them, focus will first and foremost be on how ergonomic it's to work with
futures inside async/await functions and blocks.</p>
<p>It will still take some time for the ecosystem to migrate over to <code>Futures 3.0</code>
but since the advantages are so huge, it will not be a split between libraries
using <code>Futures 1.0</code> and libraries using <code>Futures 3.0</code> for long.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#reader-exercises" id="reader-exercises">Reader exercises</a></h1>
<p>So our implementation has taken some obvious shortcuts and could use some improvement. Actually digging into the code and try things yourself is a good
way to learn. Here are some good exercises if you want to explore more:</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#avoid-threadpark" id="avoid-threadpark">Avoid <code>thread::park</code></a></h2>
<p>The big problem using <code>Thread::park</code> and <code>Thread::unpark</code> is that the user can access these same methods from their own code. Try to use another method to
suspend our thread and wake it up again on our command. Some hints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out <code>CondVars</code>, here are two sources <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(synchronization)#Condition_variables">Wikipedia</a> and the
docs for <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/struct.Condvar.html"><code>CondVar</code></a></li>
<li>Take a look at crates that help you with this exact problem like <a href="https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam">Crossbeam </a>(specifically the <a href="https://docs.rs/crossbeam/0.7.3/crossbeam/sync/struct.Parker.html"><code>Parker</code></a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#avoid-wrapping-the-whole-reactor-in-a-mutex-and-pass-it-around" id="avoid-wrapping-the-whole-reactor-in-a-mutex-and-pass-it-around">Avoid wrapping the whole <code>Reactor</code> in a mutex and pass it around</a></h2>
<p>First of all, protecting the whole <code>Reactor</code> and passing it around is overkill. We're only interested in synchronizing some parts of the information it contains. Try to refactor that out and only synchronize access to what's really needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you want to pass around a reference to this information using an <code>Arc</code>?</li>
<li>Do you want to make a global <code>Reactor</code> so it can be accessed from anywhere?</li>
</ul>
<p>Next , using a <code>Mutex</code> as a synchronization mechanism might be overkill since many methods only reads data. </p>
<ul>
<li>Could an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/struct.RwLock.html"><code>RwLock</code></a> be more efficient some places?</li>
<li>Could you use any of the synchronization mechanisms in <a href="https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam">Crossbeam</a>?</li>
<li>Do you want to dig into <a href="https://cfsamsonbooks.gitbook.io/epoll-kqueue-iocp-explained/appendix-1/atomics-in-rust">atomics in Rust and implement a synchronization mechanism</a> of your own?</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#avoid-creating-a-new-waker-for-every-event" id="avoid-creating-a-new-waker-for-every-event">Avoid creating a new Waker for every event</a></h2>
<p>Right now we create a new instance of a Waker for every event we create. Is this really needed? </p>
<ul>
<li>Could we create one instance and then cache it (see <a href="https://stjepang.github.io/2020/01/25/build-your-own-block-on.html">this article from <code>u/sjepang</code></a>)?
<ul>
<li>Should we cache it in <code>thread_local!</code> storage?</li>
<li>Or should be cache it using a global constant?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#could-we-implement-more-methods-on-our-executor" id="could-we-implement-more-methods-on-our-executor">Could we implement more methods on our executor?</a></h2>
<p>What about CPU intensive tasks? Right now they'll prevent our executor thread from progressing an handling events. Could you create a thread pool and create a method to send such tasks to the thread pool instead together with a Waker which will wake up the executor thread once the CPU intensive task is done?</p>
<p>In both <code>async_std</code> and <code>tokio</code> this method is called <code>spawn_blocking</code>, a good place to start is to read the documentation and the code thy use to implement that.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#building-a-better-exectuor" id="building-a-better-exectuor">Building a better exectuor</a></h2>
<p>Right now, we can only run one and one future. Most runtimes has a <code>spawn</code> 
function which let's you start off a future and <code>await</code> it later so you
can run multiple futures concurrently.</p>
<p>As I'm writing this <a href="https://github.com/stjepang">@stjepan</a> is writing a blog
series about implementing your own executors, and he just released a post
on how to accomplish just this you can visit <a href="https://stjepang.github.io/2020/01/31/build-your-own-executor.html">here</a>.
He knows what he's talking about so I recommend following that.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/cfsamson/examples-futures/tree/bonus_spawn">bonus_spawn</a> 
branch of the example repository you can also find an extremely simplified 
(and worse) way of accomplishing the same in only a few lines of code.</p>
